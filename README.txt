The code is divided in four folders – PCA, LDA, SVM and NeuralNet. MNIST digits are stored in AC50001_assignment2_data.mat.
	•	To run K-means clustering on the data after PCA projection, open PCA folder and run main.m script.
	•	To run K-means clustering on the data after LDA projection, open LDA folder and run main.m script.
	•	To run SVM classifier:
		o	For simple SVM classifier open SVM folder and run SVM.m script.
		o	For SVM with 5-fold cross validation open SVM folder and run SVM_5Fold.m script.
	•	To run neural networks classifier open NeuralNet folder and run main.m script.
